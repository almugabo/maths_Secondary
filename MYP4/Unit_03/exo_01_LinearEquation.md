### 2. solve this problem 

A moving company estimates that it usually needs a dozen large boxes per room when they are packing the contents of a house. They **always** bring half a dozen extra boxes just in case they are wrong or there is an accident. How many boxes will the company bring to pack:

a) an apartment with 4 rooms?  
b) a large house with 8 rooms?  
c) a sports star's mansion of 82 rooms?  
d) a hotel with 15 floors of 30 rooms each?

### 3. solve this problem 

Albie has a summer job mowing lawns. He earns ₱10 (10 pesos) for every garden lawn that he mows. Each day he works, he must spend ₱14 on fuel and ₱6 to rent the mower from his parents. Let the number of garden lawns = $g$ and the profit = $p$ (profit is the amount of money earned minus any expenses).

a) What is the equation representing the total profit earned by Albie at the end of each day?   
b) How much profit will Albie make from 10 gardens?   
c) How many gardens did he mow if his profit was ₱60?
