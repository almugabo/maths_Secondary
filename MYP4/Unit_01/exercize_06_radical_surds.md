## 3. rules of surds 

Here are three rules for surds. Use the rules of exponents to show why there are true 


| Rule Number | Label                       | Rule                                   | Explanation                                    |
|-------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1           | Product of Surds           | $(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\)$ | The square root of a product is the product of the square roots. |
| 2           | Quotient of Surds          | $(\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}\)$ | The square root of a quotient is the quotient of the square roots. |
| 3           | Square of a Surd           | $\((\sqrt{a})^2 = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{a} = a\)$ | Squaring a square root cancels the root and gives the original number. |
