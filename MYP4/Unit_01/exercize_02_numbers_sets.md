# Math Exercises: Number Sets

## 1. Describe number sets 

for each of the number sets (a) describe which numbers it contains, (b) give the symbol of each number set (Z,Q etc ...) and (c) give an example of a number and explain why it belongs to it. 

---

## 2. Classify number 

For the each of the following numbers, (a) identify to which set(s) it belongs (b) Explain why it belongs to that/those set(s) using the definition of the set(s). and (c) write down the symbol of each number set 

3/4, √2, -7, π, 0, -2.75 , √9, -0.33333333 , −√5

## 3. True or False? Justify Your Answer.

Determine if each statement is true or false. If true, explain why. If false, provide a counterexample and correct the statement.

1. All integers are rational numbers.  
2. All rational numbers are integers.  
3. All irrational numbers are real numbers.  
4. A number can be both rational and irrational.  
5. Zero is a natural number.  
6. The square root of any positive number is irrational.

## 4. Describe the number sets 

Create a Venn Diagram that shows all number sets and their relationships. Use the following sets: Natural Numbers(N), Whole Numbers (W), Integers (Z), Rational Numbers (Q), Irrational Numbers (I), Real Numbers(R)

1.	Rational Numbers
2.	Natural Numbers
3.	Whole Numbers

## 6. Terminology

Fill in the blanks for each question:

1. A number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers is called __________.  
2. A number that has a repeating decimal pattern is called  __________.  
3. A number with a decimal that neither terminates nor repeats is called __________.  
4. A number that has a positive or a negative sign is called  __________.

## 7. Terminology

The word "irrational" in everyday English suggests something that lacks reason or logic. In mathematics, we use "irrational" to describe certain numbers. In a short paragraph, explain why some numbers are called "irrational" and how this meaning differs from the everyday use of the word.

---
## 8. Properties of number sets 

Compare and contrast the properties of rational and irrational numbers. In your answer, address the following:
(a) How they differ in terms of decimal representations.
(b) At least one example of a number that belongs to each set.
(c) The types of numbers you might encounter that make it easy to determine rationality or irrationality.

## 9. Describe number sets 


Consider the chain which is given in the image  

`N ⊆ W ⊆ Z ⊆ Q ⊆ R`

(a) Explain what each symbol and set represents.
(b) Why are these subsets arranged in this order?
(c) Give an example of a number that "moves you one step up" or "one step down" this chain. For example, show how an integer you choose might or might not fit into the whole numbers.
