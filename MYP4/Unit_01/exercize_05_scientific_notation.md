## 1. Converting to Scientific Notation
Convert the following numbers into scientific notation:

- $3,000,000$  
- $0.000005$  
- $12,345,000,000$  
- $0.000000000105$  

---

## 2. Converting from Scientific Notation
Convert the following numbers from scientific notation to standard decimal notation:

- $4.5 \times 10^6$  
- $2.1 \times 10^{-4}$  
- $9.99 \times 10^3$  
- $1.0 \times 10^{-7}$

## 3. Which is Larger?
Determine which number is larger without converting to standard notation. Explain your reasoning:

- $3.4 \times 10^5$ or $8.9 \times 10^3$  
- $1.2 \times 10^{-6}$ or $5.6 \times 10^{-8}$  
- $7.0 \times 10^7$ or $7.01 \times 10^7$

## 4. Express Numbers in Scientific Notation
- Express the following numbers in scientific notation:  
  - $0.000045$  
  - $12,300,000$  

- Convert the following numbers from scientific notation to standard form:  
  - $3.2 \times 10^5$  
  - $1.5 \times 10^{-4}$

## 5. Explain the Parts
In the number $6.02 \times 10^{23}$:
- What is the coefficient?  
- What is the base?  
- What is the exponent?  
- What does each part represent?

## 6. Astronomy
- The distance to the Andromeda galaxy is approximately $2.5 \times 10^{19}$ kilometers. Write this distance out in standard decimal notation (it might be long!).  
- The diameter of a hydrogen atom is about $1.06 \times 10^{-10}$ meters. How many times larger is the Andromeda galaxy's distance than the diameter of a hydrogen atom? Express your answer in scientific notation.

## 7. Biology
A single human cell contains about 3 billion base pairs of DNA:

- Write this number in scientific notation.  
- If the average length of a DNA base pair is about $0.34$ nanometers ($1$ nanometer $= 10^{-9}$ meters), what is the approximate total length of DNA in a single human cell (in meters)? Express your answer in scientific notation.

---

## 8. Technology
A computer's hard drive capacity is often measured in terabytes (TB). One terabyte is approximately equal to $10^{12}$ bytes.

- A data center stores 1 petabyte (PB) of data. Express this amount in bytes using scientific notation. (Hint: Research how many terabytes are in a petabyte.)  
- If a single byte can store one character of text, how many characters of text can be stored in the data center? Express your answer in scientific notation.

## 9. Explain the Need
Why do we use scientific notation? Explain its advantages when working with extremely large or small numbers. Give specific examples.

---

## 10. Error Analysis
A student wrote the number $0.00000072$ as $7.2 \times 10^5$. Explain the student's error and write the correct representation of the number in scientific notation.

---

## 11. Comparing Scales
Order the following from smallest to largest: the diameter of the Earth, the distance to the Moon, the width of a human hair, the size of a bacteria cell. Use scientific notation to express each quantity (you'll need to research the approximate values).
