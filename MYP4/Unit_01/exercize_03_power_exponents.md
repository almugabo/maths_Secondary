## 1. Knowing that the power of a number is repeated multiplication, out the rules of exponents

| Rule | Name                     | Formula                          |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1    | Product of Powers        | $(a^n \times a^m) =$             |
| 2    | Quotient of Powers       | $(\frac{a^n}{a^m}) =$            |
| 3    | Power of a Power         | $(a^m)^n = $                     |
| 4    | Identity Exponent        | $a^1 = $                        |
| 5    | Zero Exponent            | $a^0 =$                         |
| 6    | Negative Exponent        | $a^{-n} = $                     |
| 7    | Power of a Product       | $(a \cdot b)^n = $              |
| 8    | Power of a Quotient      | $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n =$  |

## 2. Terminology 

In mathematics, define following terms 
- Exponent (also called index)
- Base 

---

## 3. Simplify and Explain
Simplify each expression, showing your steps and stating which exponent rule you used for each step:

- $x^5 \cdot x^3$  
- $(y^2)^4$  
- $\frac{a^6}{a^2}$  
- $(2m^3n^2)^5$  
- $\left(\frac{5^3}{5}\right)^2$

---

## 4. Explain This
- **Difference Between Powers:**  
  - Explain the difference between $3^4$ and $4^3$ in your own words.
- **Why Does $x^0 = 1$?**  
  - Why does any number (except 0) raised to the power of 0 equal 1? Explain the reasoning.
-**Error explanation**
- A student simplified $(4x^2)^{-1}$ to $-4x^2$. Explain what the student did wrong and provide the correct simplification.

## 5. Laws of exponents 

What are the 8 laws of exponents

## 6. Evaluate
Calculate the value of each expression:

- $4^{-2}$  
- $(-3)^0$  
- $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{-3}$  
- $2^5 \cdot 2^{-3}$  
- $(3^2)^{-1}$

---

## 7. Simplify
Simplify the following expressions, leaving your answer in exponent form with positive exponents:

- $(x^{1/2})^4$  
- $(y^{2/3})^{1/2}$  
- $a^{-1/3} \cdot a^{2/3}$

---

## 8. True or False? Justify
Are the following statements true or false? Explain your reasoning.

* $2^{-3}$ is a negative number.  
* Any number raised to a negative exponent is a fraction.

## 9. Geometry Application
The volume of a cube is given by the formula $V = s^3$, where $s$ is the side length.

- **Find Side Length:**  
  If a cube has a volume of 64 cubic units, what is its side length? Explain your process.
- **Doubling Side Length:**  
  If you double the side length of a cube, how does its volume change? Explain using exponents.

## 10. Comparing Growth
Bacteria A doubles every hour, while Bacteria B triples every two hours.

- **Exponential Growth Expressions:**  
  Write expressions using exponents to represent the growth of each bacteria population after $t$ hours. (Hint: Think carefully about how to represent the tripling every two hours using exponents.)
- **Compare Populations:**  
  Which bacteria will have a larger population after 6 hours? Justify your answer.
