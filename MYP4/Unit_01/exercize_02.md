# Math Exercises: Number Sets

## 1. Classify Each Number

**Instructions:** For each of the following numbers, identify to which set(s) it belongs (Natural Numbers, Whole Numbers, Integers, Rational Numbers, Irrational Numbers, Real Numbers). *Explain why* it belongs to that/those set(s) using the definition of the set(s).

### Example Table:
| Number      | Number Class                               | Symbols   | Justification                                                                                                                                         |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -5          | Integers, Rational Numbers, Real Numbers   | $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}$ | It is a negative whole number (integer), can be expressed as a fraction $\frac{-5}{1}$ , and is part of the real number system.                               |

## 2. True or False? Justify Your Answer.

Determine if each statement is true or false. If true, explain why. If false, provide a counterexample and correct the statement.

1. All integers are rational numbers.  
2. All rational numbers are integers.  
3. All irrational numbers are real numbers.  
4. A number can be both rational and irrational.  
5. Zero is a natural number.  
6. The square root of any positive number is irrational.

## 3. Problem Solving

**Question 1:**  
The side length of a square is $\( \sqrt{7} \)$ units. Is the perimeter of the square a rational or irrational number? Explain your reasoning. What about the area?

**Question 2:**  
A recipe calls for \( 2 \frac{1}{2} \) cups of flour. You only have a measuring cup that measures in thirds of a cup. How many thirds of a cup do you need? Explain your reasoning using the concepts of rational numbers.

## 4. Create a Venn Diagram

**Task:**  
Create a Venn Diagram that shows all number sets and their relationships. Use the following sets: Natural Numbers (\( \mathbb{N} \)), Whole Numbers (\( \mathbb{W} \)), Integers (\( \mathbb{Z} \)), Rational Numbers (\( \mathbb{Q} \)), Irrational Numbers (\( \mathbb{I} \)), Real Numbers (\( \mathbb{R} \)).

## 5. Why Are Some Numbers Called "Irrational"?

In English, the word "irrational" means "not logical or reasonable." Why do we call certain numbers "irrational"? Write a brief explanation.

---

## 6. Definitions and Examples of Number Sets

For each of the following number sets, provide a definition and an example:

1. **Rational Numbers (\( \mathbb{Q} \))**  
2. **Natural Numbers (\( \mathbb{N} \))**  
3. **Whole Numbers (\( \mathbb{W} \))**  
4. **Integers (\( \mathbb{Z} \))**  
5. **Irrational Numbers (\( \mathbb{I} \))**

---

## 7. Terminology

Fill in the blanks for each question:

1. A number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers is called a(n) __________.  
2. A number that has a repeating decimal pattern is called a(n) __________.  
3. A number with a decimal that neither terminates nor repeats is called a(n) __________.  
4. A number that has a positive or a negative sign is called a(n) __________.
