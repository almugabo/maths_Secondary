# 3. Rounding Techniques

## 1. Round to Decimal Places
Round each number to the specified number of decimal places:

- $3.14159$ to 2 decimal places  
- $0.4567$ to 3 decimal places  
- $12.999$ to 1 decimal place  
- $-2.548$ to the nearest tenth  

---

## 2. Round to Significant Figures
Round each number to the specified number of significant figures:

- $45,678$ to 3 significant figures  
- $0.003215$ to 2 significant figures  
- $9.9999$ to 4 significant figures  
- $200.001$ to 1 significant figure (this is a tricky one!)

## 3. Explain the Rules
- **Rounding When the Next Digit is Exactly 5:**  
  Explain, in your own words, the rules for rounding when the next digit is exactly 5. Give examples to support your explanation.

- **Why Do We Round Numbers?**  
  Give at least two real-world reasons for rounding.

- **Why Consider Significant Figures?**  
  Why is it important to consider significant figures when performing calculations in science and engineering?

## 4. Measurement Scenario
Imagine you're measuring the length of a table with a ruler that only has markings down to centimeters. You measure it as $153$ centimeters.

- **Range of Possible Lengths:**  
  What is the range of possible actual lengths of the table? (Think about the upper and lower bounds due to the limitation of the ruler.)
  
- **Rounding to the Nearest Ten:**  
  If you reported the measurement as $150$ cm (rounded to the nearest ten), how does that affect the accuracy of your measurement?
  
- **Error Calculation:**  
  You then use a more precise measuring tape and find the table is actually $153.4$ cm long. If you round this to $153$ cm:  
  - What is the absolute error?  (actual measurement – approximate measurement)
  - What is the relative error?  (absolute error / actual length)

## 5. Baking Scenario
A recipe calls for $2.345$ grams of salt. You only have a scale that measures to the nearest tenth of a gram.

- **Rounding for the Scale:**  
  To how many grams of salt should you round? Explain your reasoning.
  
- **Impact on Recipe Outcome:**  
  If you consistently round all ingredients in a complex recipe, how might that affect the final outcome? Would it be better to consistently round up, round down, or use another approach?

## 6. Significant Figures in Calculations
- **Perform a Calculation:**  
  Perform the following calculation: $12.34 \times 5.678$. What is the answer with the correct number of significant figures? Explain your reasoning.

---

## 7. Newspaper Headlines
Analyze the following (fictional) newspaper headlines and explain whether the rounding used is appropriate or misleading, and why:

- **Headline 1:** "Unemployment Rate Drops to $5.6\%$ - Economy Booming!"  
  (Actual rate was $5.58\%$)

- **Headline 2:** "Local School Raises $10,000 for Charity!"  
  (Actual amount was $10,015)

- **Headline 3:** "Scientists Discover Planet Weighing $1,000,000$ kg"  
  (High level of uncertainty in the measurement)

## 8. Rounding in Financial Contexts
- **Bank Balance Rounding:**  
  Your bank balance is $125.5678$, but the bank rounds balances to the nearest cent. What will your balance display as, and why?  

- **Rounding Interest Rates:**  
  A bank advertises an interest rate of $3.4567\%$. Should they round it to $3.46\%$, $3.5\%$, or leave it as is? Explain how the choice of rounding might affect customer perception.  

- **Cumulative Rounding Error:**  
  If interest is calculated daily over a year and each day’s rounding introduces a $0.01$ error, how much cumulative error could result after a year?

---

## 9. Data Reporting in Surveys
- **Population Survey:**  
  A survey reports that $45.7\%$ of participants prefer online shopping. If the survey had $1,000$ participants, how many people does that represent? Round appropriately and explain your reasoning.

- **Margin of Error:**  
  The survey mentions a margin of error of $1.5\%$. Explain how rounding might affect the interpretation of the survey results.

- **Appropriate Precision:**  
  In a survey of $500$ people, is it reasonable to report results to $3$ decimal places (e.g., $45.678\%$)? Why or why not?

---

## 10. Rounding in Technology
- **Software Calculations:**  
  A computer program stores numbers as floating-point values and rounds them to $2$ decimal places for display. What potential issues could arise when performing multiple calculations with rounded values?

- **Pixel Dimensions:**  
  A graphic design tool rounds pixel dimensions to the nearest integer. If an image width is calculated as $10.7$ pixels, and height as $15.3$ pixels, what impact does rounding to $11$ and $15$ pixels have on the aspect ratio?

- **Scientific Simulations:**  
  A simulation rounds all inputs to $4$ significant figures. Discuss the potential trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy in this scenario.
