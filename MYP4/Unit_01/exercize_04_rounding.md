# 3. Rounding Techniques

## 1. Round to Decimal Places
Round each number to the specified number of decimal places:

- $3.14159$ to 2 decimal places  
- $0.4567$ to 3 decimal places  
- $12.999$ to 1 decimal place  
- $-2.548$ to the nearest tenth  

---

## 2. Round to Significant Figures
Round each number to the specified number of significant figures:

- $45,678$ to 3 significant figures  
- $0.003215$ to 2 significant figures  
- $9.9999$ to 4 significant figures  
- $200.001$ to 1 significant figure (this is a tricky one!)

## 3. Explain the Rules
- **Rounding When the Next Digit is Exactly 5:**  
  Explain, in your own words, the rules for rounding when the next digit is exactly 5. Give examples to support your explanation.

- **Why Do We Round Numbers?**  
  Give at least two real-world reasons for rounding.

## 4. Measurement Scenario
Imagine you're measuring the length of a table with a ruler that only has markings down to centimeters. You measure it as $153$ centimeters.

- **Range of Possible Lengths:**  
  What is the range of possible actual lengths of the table? (Think about the upper and lower bounds due to the limitation of the ruler.)
  
- **Rounding to the Nearest Ten:**  
  If you reported the measurement as $150$ cm (rounded to the nearest ten), how does that affect the accuracy of your measurement?
  
- **Error Calculation:**  
  You then use a more precise measuring tape and find the table is actually $153.4$ cm long. If you round this to $153$ cm:  
  - What is the absolute error?  
  - What is the relative error?

## 5. Baking Scenario
A recipe calls for $2.345$ grams of salt. You only have a scale that measures to the nearest tenth of a gram.

- **Rounding for the Scale:**  
  To how many grams of salt should you round? Explain your reasoning.
  
- **Impact on Recipe Outcome:**  
  If you consistently round all ingredients in a complex recipe, how might that affect the final outcome? Would it be better to consistently round up, round down, or use another approach?

## 6. Significant Figures in Calculations
- **Perform a Calculation:**  
  Perform the following calculation: $12.34 \times 5.678$. What is the answer with the correct number of significant figures? Explain your reasoning.

- **Why Consider Significant Figures?**  
  Why is it important to consider significant figures when performing calculations in science and engineering?

## 7. Newspaper Headlines
Analyze the following (fictional) newspaper headlines and explain whether the rounding used is appropriate or misleading, and why:

- **Headline 1:** "Unemployment Rate Drops to $5.6\%$ - Economy Booming!"  
  (Actual rate was $5.58\%$)

- **Headline 2:** "Local School Raises $10,000 for Charity!"  
  (Actual amount was $10,015)

- **Headline 3:** "Scientists Discover Planet Weighing $1,000,000$ kg"  
  (High level of uncertainty in the measurement)
