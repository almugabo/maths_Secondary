MYP mathematics Framework: 

4 branches of Mathematics: 
(1) Number
(2) Algebra
(3) Geometry and Trigonometry 
(4) Statistics and Probability 

3 key concepts & 12 related concepts 

(1) Form  
(2) logic 
(3) relationships 

Form => structure/shape e.g. graphs in statistics
Logic => process used to reach conclusions about numbers, shapes, variables
Relationships => connections between quantities, properties or concept expressed as models, rules, statements

Three phases of learning: 
(1) Inquiry : ask question 
(2) Action : learning by doing 
(3) Reflection : ask new questions
