**Exercise Set 1: Introduction to Algebraic Simplification and Relationships**

1. **Scenario:** Imagine you are designing a rectangular garden. You want the length to be 3 meters longer than the width.  
    * **Task (a):**  Write an algebraic expression to represent the perimeter of the garden in terms of its width (w). Explain what your variables represent and why you chose that specific expression.
    * **Task (b):** If you have 26 meters of fencing, write an equation to represent the situation. Explain how this equation relates to the perimeter expression you wrote in part (a).
    * **Task (c):**  Could you represent the perimeter in terms of the length (l) instead? Write an expression for the perimeter in terms of length and explain how it's different from the expression you wrote in terms of width.  


2. **Pattern Recognition:** Observe the following pattern:
   * Figure 1: 3 dots
   * Figure 2: 5 dots
   * Figure 3: 7 dots  
    * **Task (a):** Describe the pattern in words.
    * **Task (b):** Write an algebraic expression to represent the number of dots in Figure 'n'. Explain how you arrived at this expression.
    * **Task (c):** How many dots would be in Figure 10?  Show your work using the algebraic expression.
    * **Task (d):**  Which figure would have 27 dots? Explain how you found your answer.


**Exercise Set 2: Basic Operations in Algebra**

1. **Simplification Challenge:** Simplify the following expressions, showing all your steps and explaining the reasoning behind each step:
    * **(a):**  5x + 3y - 2x + 7y
    * **(b):** 3(2a - 4b) + 5a - 2b
    * **(c):** 4(x + 3) - 2(x - 1)  
    * **(d):**  Explain the difference between "terms" and "factors" in the expression 2(x + 3)


2. **Real-World Application:** A mobile phone company charges a monthly fee of $20 plus $0.05 per minute of talk time.
    * **Task (a):** Write an algebraic expression to represent the total monthly cost (C) in terms of the number of minutes used (m).  Explain what each part of your expression represents.
    * **Task (b):** If Sarah used 200 minutes in a month, what would her total cost be? Show your calculation using the algebraic expression.
    * **Task (c):** If John's bill was $35, how many minutes did he use? Explain how you solved this problem.


3. **Error Analysis:** A student simplified the expression 6x - (2x + 5) to 4x + 5. Identify the error the student made. Explain the correct way to simplify the expression and provide the correct answer.


**Exercise Set 2: Expansion and Factorization**

1. **Expanding Expressions:**
   **(a)** Expand the expression (2x + 3)(x - 5) using the FOIL method. Show each step clearly and explain what FOIL stands for.
   **(b)** Expand (3y - 4)² using the distributive property (or any other method you prefer). Explain why you cannot simply square each term inside the parentheses.  Show the correct expansion.  
   **(c)** A student expanded (x + 5)(x - 2) and got x² - 10 as the answer.  Identify and explain the error(s) in the student's work. Show the correct expansion.

2. **Factorization:**
    **(a)** Factorize the expression 12ab + 8a²b. Explain how you identified the common factors.  Explain what "greatest common factor" means.
    **(b)** Factorize the expression x² - 7x + 10. Show your work and explain your reasoning for choosing the factors you did. Explain how your factored expression is equivalent to the original expression.
    **(c)**  Explain how factorization is the reverse of expansion.  Use an example to illustrate your explanation.  Start with an expression, expand it, then factor it back to its original form, explaining each step.  

**Exercise Set 6: Quadratic Expressions**

1. **Expanding Quadratics:**
    **(a)** Expand and simplify the expression (x + 4)(x - 3). Verify your answer by substituting x=2 into both the original expression and the expanded expression.
    **(b)** A rectangle has a length of (x+5) cm and a width of (x-2) cm. Find an expression for the area of the rectangle in expanded form.  Explain what your expression represents.

2. **Factorizing Quadratics:**
    **(a)** Factorize the quadratic expression x² - 5x - 14. Show your work and explain your strategy for finding the factors.
    **(b)** Factorize x² + 10x + 25. What is special about the factors you found in this case?  What is this type of quadratic expression called?
    **(c)** The area of a rectangular garden is given by the expression x² + x - 6.  Find expressions for the possible length and width of the garden in terms of x.  Assuming x represents a positive number, could the length of the garden be shorter than the width?  Explain.

3. **Challenging Factorization:**
    **(a)** Factorize 2x² + 7x + 3. Show your work.  Explain why this factorization is more challenging than previous examples.
    **(b)** Create a quadratic expression that can be factorized into (2x - 1)(x + 5).
