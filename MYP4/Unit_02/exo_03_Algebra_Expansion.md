## 10. Quadratic Equations in Context 

The area of a rectangular garden is $120 \, \text{m}^2$. The length of the garden is $4 \, \text{m}$ longer than its width.

a) Write an expression for the length of the garden.
b) Write a quadratic equation to represent this situation and simplify 
c) Solve the quadratic equation to find the dimensions of the garden.  
**Hint:** Move all the terms to the left-hand side of the equation. Then, factorise and find the value(s) of $x$ so that the equation equals zero.

d) Write the width and length of the garden clearly.

e) Verify your solution by calculating the area using the found dimensions.
